# Misinformation Project - Microsoft

## About This Project

Based on data collected by the Carter Center, misinformation narratives are widespread on social media, with a large portion of users exposed to narratives ranging from election fraud to COVID-19 misinformation. To reduce the spread of these narratives, identification of trending topics is vital for platforms and independent monitors to guide mitigation efforts. 

In this project, we first started with our exploratory data analysis by building an extractor to explore the possible financial gains within the domains and articles, along with discovering the relationships between all the data features using data visualization techniques. From the results of our visualization, we observed various relationships between topics and misinformation domains. Therefore, we decided to investigate methods to extract topic information from news article content. We compared the performance of the supervised model and unsupervised model, and evaluated each on data that represent different time periods and news topic trends.
