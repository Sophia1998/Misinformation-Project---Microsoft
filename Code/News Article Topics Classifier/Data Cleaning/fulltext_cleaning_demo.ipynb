President Trump, on the other hand, has demandedthe package be reworked to include $2,000 stimulus checks for each American.On a call with reporters this week, Biden transition team officials said, they plan on providing funding to improve shelter and humanitarian assistance to immigrants waiting in northern Mexico, as well as provide COVID-19 testing to ensure people presenting at POE have a negative test before being processed, according to a Buzzfeed News report.Apparently the Biden administration plans to offer shelter and assistance to visa-less migrants even before they try to cross the border, including COVID testing.
